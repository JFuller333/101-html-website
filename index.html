                         <div class="half-width">
                            <p>I’ve made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island, with my small growing family. 
                                My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing 
                                my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. 
                                I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.</p>

                         <div class="half-width">
                            <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to 
                                build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & 
                                versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I’ve made a full switch to front-end 
                                development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, 
                                elegant code.</p>

                        <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                        <p> My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to 
                            make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, 
                            trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        <h3> Well Organized CSS</h3>
                        <p> I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus
                            on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up 
                            to date on current best practices</p>
